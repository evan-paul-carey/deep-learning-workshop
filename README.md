These are the supporting materials for a deep learning workshop developed by Evan Carey, to be presented at the International Conference on Health Policy Statistics in San Diego on 1/6/2020.  

## Introduction and software installation video

Please watch the video above for a brief introduction and instructions on how to prepare your computer for the workshop. We will be using Python and Tensorflow (no GPU required, you can run on a laptop) for this course. You have the option of setting up a local install of Tensorflow via Anaconda, or you can use the google colab cloud environment which requires a google account, but no setup on your computer. So if you would like to follow-along and run code, you must either:

* install tensorflow to your computer via anaconda 
* or use your google account to log into google colab

I have written up instructions for installation as well and posted them under the file 'InstallGuide.md'. You should see it listed at the first level. Click on it to view it. 

Please watch the video and attempt setup prior to coming to the workshop if at all possible! The workshop is a short two hours with 50+ registered attendees. We will not have time to troubleshoot installations during that two hours. If you have any questions or issues, I will be available to trouble shoot in person from 7:00-7:50 AM on Monday, 1/6, at the conference near the workshop areas. 

Update @ 1/6/2020 - 7AM: I am sitting in the group of blue chairs in the hotel lobby outside the west coast ballroom. I am a 6' caucasian male with brown hair wearing a blue suit and a white shirt. Feel free to come ask for any install help! I am attending another workshop at 8 AM so I will be here until 7:50.
